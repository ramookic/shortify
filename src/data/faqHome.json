    "question": "How do URL shorteners work?",
    "answer": "URL shorteners work by taking a long URL and generating a shorter alias for it. They maintain a database that maps the short alias to the original URL. When someone clicks on the short link, the service looks up the alias in its database and redirects the user to the corresponding long URL."
